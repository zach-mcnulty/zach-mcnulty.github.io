          <h2>My experience</h2>
          <p>From 2022 to 2025, I worked as a front-end engineer for a logistics industry start-up in Kansas City, Missouri.</p>
          <p>I contributed to a wide variety of business-critical projects, the most recent of which helped reshape that company’s entire approach to its daily operations.</p>
          <p>
            More generally in that role, I contributed the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Built responsive, intuitive UIs with a focus on clean design and strong user experience</li>
              <li>Managed complex, interdependent network requests with reliable error handling</li>
              <li>Designed interfaces and features around dense, structured datasets</li>
              <li>Championed testing and code coverage to support stability and long-term development</li>
              <li>Improved code readability, extensibility, and maintainability through thoughtful refactoring and best practices</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, I’m building a full-stack CRUD application called Wishlists built with Vue 3, TailwindCSS, FastAPI, SQLModel and Firebase Authentication.

          <h2>My journey</h2>
          <p>I love web development, because it allows me to be creative and requires me to be meticulous.</p>
          <p>But it took me a while to find.</p>
          <p>I discovered software development in 2020, nearly a decade after I graduated from college in 2011. Within that decade, I was employed as a high school English teacher, a local newspaper reporter and a social media manager.</p>
          <p>I gained valuable insights at each of those waypoints, most importantly the knowledge that my destination was elsewhere. Seeking greater personal and professional fulfillment, I made a move toward web development at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
          <p>I've since developed a robust skillset from the ground up (with plenty of help along the way).</p>
          <p>I have 3 years of professional experience developing exceptional user interfaces, and I am actively growing my skillset to round myself out as a full-stack dev.</p>
          <p>I'm familiar with an array of modern libraries, tools and approaches to develop full-featured web applications.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, I'm interested in building cool stuff, building it well and making my dog proud.</p>
